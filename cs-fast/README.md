# What's next?
I would advise you to have a look at the resources linked above which this document takes inspiration from. They contain books and resources that go much deeper into detail. As a suggestion, I would pick up more books on the topics of operating systems internals, compilers, design patterns and modern development practices.

# Contributing
Do you know books that are shorter and offer the same content, or slightly longer but more comprehensive? Please open a new issue with your suggestions.
